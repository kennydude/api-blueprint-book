API Blueprint
=============

API Blueprint is a format for using Markdown to document APIs. It can also test your APIs and give you a mock version of your API from the same document.

[Apiary](https://apiary.io) is a company which created API Blueprint as an open source project. They offer an online editor, support and a lot more out of the box without having to set anything up. However, if you can't or don't want to everything can be done seperately.
